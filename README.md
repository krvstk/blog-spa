## Personal website made from scratch

This is Serverless Single Page Application powered by **Angular 12** and **Firebase Cloud Services**.

## :boom: Purpose of creation

I wanted to develop application, where I could use my knowledge and expand it. 
Practicing front-end skills was also a goal. I have always been interested in whole process of development
from idea to complete implementation.

Moreover, from now I have additional channel of communication and place, where I can share my
knowledge with other developers in blog posts.

## :fire: Further improvements

During development I have collected some technical debt and I am going to repay it soon.
I tried to make it as scalable as possible using best practice, still it has room
for improvements. I will write posts during those steps.

## :hammer: Technologies and concepts used

As was mentioned - primary framework used is **Angular** of the last version for now.
It doesn't have back-end at all, all the processing is coming from **Firebase**. 
I am using **Firestore**, **Authentication**, **Storage** and **Hosting** from there.
Also:
- RxJs
- Angular Material
- Scss
- Quill Text Editor and ngx-loader

### Angular concepts
- Reactive Forms
- Routing
- Animations 
- Services
- Reusable Components
- Angular CLI
- Lazy Loading 
etc.
